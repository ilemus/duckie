# Long form notes on a design for a simple mind
## The mind of a dog
A dog has complex thought and understanding of its surroundings.
It can conceptualize the world around it through senses (touch, taste, sight, hearing and smell) with a strong sense of smell and hearing.
The signals it receives can be recognized as patterns and be associated to a concept.
The concept could be a simple reaction or a complex though.

For example a dog can hear a command like "sit" and associate it with a concept of sitting and respond by performing the action.
The dog takes in the sense of hearing, recognizes the source, validates that the source is trustworthy, interprets the command and willfully responds to the command, and starts to perform the action.
The dog can also willfully decide not to comply, either if the source is not trustworthy or if the dog is not in the mood, or it is unsafe or impossible to perform the action.

Each component of this thought can be broken down into smaller components which make up different parts of the dog's brain.
Neurons in the ear pick up sound that is decoded and categorized by pitch, volume, and other characteristics.
The dog's sense of time organizes the sounds into discrete events.
The dog's memory recalls each event of sound and retrieves the associated pattern of the sound.
The dog uses the pattern of sounds to recognize the source of the sound and the meaning of the sound.
The dog uses the sound in coordination with context including sight, spacial awareness, and smell to determine if the source is trustworthy.

To do so neurons transmit the sense of smell, sight and a sense of space to the dog's working memory.
The dog evaluates the situation and decides if it is safe to comply with the command.
If the dog decides to comply, it starts executing a sequence of actions to perform the command.
These actions are performed by muscle memory which is a sequence of neurons that fire in a specific order to perform the action.
The dog's sense of time keeps track of the sequence of actions and the dog's sense of space keeps track of the position of the dog's body.
The dog's sense of touch keeps track of the position of the dog's body and the dog's sense of balance keeps track of the position of the dog's body.
The dog's sense of sight keeps track of the position of the dog's body.

### How can we model this?
We can model this by creating a set of neurons that represent each of the dog's senses.
Each neuron will have a set of inputs and a set of outputs.
The inputs will be the signals from the dog's senses.
The outputs will be signals to the dog's muscles, organs, and other neurons.
The neurons will be organized into a network of neurons.
Each neuron will have a set of inputs and a set of outputs.

### Additional considerations
Each model of the dog's brain should be distinct and perform a specific function.
The model of hearing should be distinct from the model of sight.
The model of memory should be distinct from the model of thought.

### How can we model this in code?
Using a text prompt we can bypass the need for a model of the dog's senses.
We can use a text prompt to simulate the dog's senses.

To code the dog's brain we can use a set of functions that represent the dog's senses.
Each function will take in a set of inputs and return a set of outputs.

We can use libraries for the neural network modeling:
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
- [Caffe2](https://caffe2.ai/)

Using tensorflow we can model the dog's brain.
Tensorflow's neural network modeling library is a good choice because it is well documented and has a large community of users.
Tensorflow's neural network modeling library is also well supported by Google.
